              There are more than 70,000 people who live within the District 10
              boundaries. Did you know that there are more than 6,000 businesses
              located within District 10 boundaries, too? 3,500 of them have
              fewer than four employees.

            <p>
              This concentration of businesses and residents makes Perfect 10 an
              ideal spot to realize the 20 minute neighborhood: as in a
              neighborhood should have everything you need to survive and thrive
              within a 20 minute walk, ride, or roll. We're certainly not trying
              to take your car from you. But if you want to go to the grocery
              store, work, your favorite restaurant, or your favorite
              entertainment spot, you should feel safe to do so without a car.
              It's good for the planet, it's good for physical health, and it's
              good for community when we get out of our cars and see one another
              on the sidewalks and bike lanes.
            </p>
            <p>
              To realize that 20 minute neighborhood vision, we’re committed to
              providing resources to support you and your business just as we're
              committed to representing all those who live in Denver's Perfect
              10.

                  City Council makes laws, budgets City money, and can
                  investigate City agencies and employees. Since 1971, the
                  Council has had 13 council members -- 11 from equally
                  populated districts and two elected at large. Council members,
                  who must be at least 25 years old, U.S. citizens, and two-year
                  Denver residents who live in the District boundaries in which
                  they represent, are all elected at the same time every four
                  years. Council committees, each concerned with various areas
                  of city government, meet frequently to discuss and prepare
                  proposed laws.

                  City Council makes laws, budgets City money, and can
                  investigate City agencies and employees. Since 1971, the
                  Council has had 13 council members -- 11 from equally
                  populated districts and two elected at large. Council members,
                  who must be at least 25 years old, U.S. citizens, and two-year
                  Denver residents who live in the District boundaries in which
                  they represent, are all elected at the same time every four
                  years. Council committees, each concerned with various areas
                  of city government, meet frequently to discuss and prepare
                  proposed laws.
