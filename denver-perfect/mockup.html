He went back to the Cox School of Business at SMU and earned an MBA in Finance and Strategy.  He’s worked in software sales and in financial planning and analysis, including setting and managing the budget of a software company and using financial models to determine which projects to pursue.

On August 26, 2008, Chris’ life changed fundamentally. After photographing the Democratic National Convention, Chris was involved in a motor vehicle crash which paralyzed him from the chest down.

              I believe every Denverite should be within a 20-minute walk, roll, or ride of everything they need. Decades ago, this 20-minute vision was the reality for neighborhoods. But as cars became part of everyday life, cities planned growth around them. Commutes increased, grocery stores consolidated, and it became difficult to impossible to access basic necessities.

            </p>
            <p  class="fw-semi-bold small">Development is part of this solution. Many District 10 residents want to see an end to homelessness but also don’t want to see their neighborhood become more dense or change in zoning. Unfortunately, that’s just not possible. Density, zoning, and housing are all inextricably linked to homelessness. <span class="fw-bold">

            <p  class="fw-semi-bold small">I don’t want to take away people’s cars. If you prefer driving, there’s still a place for you in Denver’s transit system. But we need to provide safe alternatives to driving to control traffic and the environmental impact of cars. Plenty of folks prefer not to drive, but have to choose between driving and risking their lives. For those who would walk, roll, or ride instead of driving, we need to provide a functioning transit system, protected bike lanes, and safe sidewalks.</p>
            <p class="fw-semi-bold small">While it takes less than three days for a pothole to get patched, the city’s sidewalks have languished for decades. 10% of Denver has no sidewalks at all. 30% are too narrow for people in wheelchairs to use. And the sidewalks that exist or are wide enough are often in disrepair. My work prioritizes people, not cars.</p>
